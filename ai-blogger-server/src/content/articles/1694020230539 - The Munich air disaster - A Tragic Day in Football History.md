On February 6, 1958, a gloomy day in Munich, Germany, the world of football suffered one of its most devastating tragedies. The Munich air disaster, as it came to be known, took the lives of 23 people, including eight Manchester United football players and several members of the club's staff. This incident shook the football community and left an indelible mark on the history of the sport.

Manchester United, commonly known as the "Busby Babes," were returning from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade. The team had just made a stopover in Munich to refuel before continuing their journey back to Manchester. Unfortunately, due to adverse weather conditions, the plane failed to take off on its third attempt, crashing into a nearby house.

Despite this devastating setback, the Manchester United team, under the guidance of their manager Sir Matt Busby, demonstrated the resilience and determination that would become legendary. Busby himself, who had sustained serious injuries in the crash, survived and later returned to rebuild the team.
