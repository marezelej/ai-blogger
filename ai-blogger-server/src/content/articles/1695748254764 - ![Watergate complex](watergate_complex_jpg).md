*The Watergate complex*
In February 1972, one of the most infamous political scandals in American history began â€” the Watergate scandal. It involved a break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters located in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. This event would eventually lead to the downfall of President Richard Nixon and reshape American politics.

On the night of June 17, 1972, five men were caught by security guards while attempting to place listening devices in the DNC office. These individuals were later discovered to be connected to the White House and Nixon's reelection campaign. This initial break-in was just the tip of the iceberg, as it unveiled a series of illegal activities, including attempts to cover up the involvement of high-ranking officials within the Nixon administration.

Two intrepid investigative journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein from The Washington Post, were instrumental in unraveling the complex web of deceit surrounding the scandal. Through their diligent reporting and the cooperation of an anonymous source known as "Deep Throat," later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt, they exposed the involvement of the White House, leading to extensive investigations.

As more information came to light, it became evident that Nixon and his closest aides were involved in a wide range of illegal activities, including obstruction of justice, campaign finance violations, and abuse of power. Through secret recordings made in the Oval Office, Nixon's complicity in the cover-up became undeniable.

Eventually, the investigations led to the discovery of the infamous "Smoking Gun" tape, recorded on June 23, 1972, just six days after the initial break-in. In this tape, Nixon discusses plans to obstruct the FBI's investigation into the burglary. Due to mounting pressure and the threat of impeachment, Nixon resigned from the presidency on August 8, 1974. He became the first and only U.S. President to resign from office.
