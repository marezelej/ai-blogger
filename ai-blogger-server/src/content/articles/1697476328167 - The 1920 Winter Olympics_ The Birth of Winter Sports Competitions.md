In 1920, the world witnessed the birth of a new era in sports as the first ever Winter Olympics took place in Chamonix, France, from January 25 to February 4. Fourteen nations participated in this historic event, which marked the beginning of what would become a celebrated tradition.

The 1920 Winter Olympics were originally planned as part of the 1920 Summer Olympics being held in Antwerp, Belgium. However, due to the interest in winter sports, Chamonix was awarded the privilege of hosting the winter edition. The competitions included a total of eight sports: figure skating, ice hockey, curling, military patrol, speed skating, Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing, and ski jumping.

One of the most remarkable moments of the games was the introduction of the sport of figure skating to the Olympics. Deviating from traditional Olympic sports like track and field, the elegance and artistry of figure skating captured the world's attention. It has since become one of the most anticipated events in the Winter Olympics.

A memorable highlight of the 1920 Winter Olympics was the victory of the Canadian ice hockey team. Dominating the tournament, they defeated their opponents effortlessly, scoring 29 goals while conceding only one. This triumph marked the beginning of Canada's unrivaled dominance in Olympic ice hockey.
