On July 1, 1997, at midnight, a handover ceremony took place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The ceremony represented the transfer of power from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. British officials lowered the Union Jack flag and handed over Hong Kong's sovereignty to Chinese officials, who raised the Chinese national flag. This symbolic act signified the end of British colonial rule in Hong Kong and the beginning of China's "one country, two systems" policy, which aimed to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and capitalist economic system.

The handover of Hong Kong had a significant impact on its population. For many Hong Kongers, this event evoked a mix of emotions, including hope, uncertainty, and anxiety about the future. Concerns about political freedom, civil liberties, and the preservation of Hong Kong's distinct culture and way of life became prominent as China asserted its authority.

Despite these concerns, Hong Kong continued to thrive as a global financial hub and commercial powerhouse. Its unique status as a Special Administrative Region within China allowed it to maintain its own legal and economic systems, ensuring its distinctiveness from mainland China.

The Hong Kong handover in July 1997 holds great significance as a turning point in the city's history. It marked the end of British colonial rule and the beginning of a new era under Chinese sovereignty. This historic fact continues to shape Hong Kong's identity and its ongoing struggle for political and social autonomy.
