On May 13, 1981, the world was shocked when Pope John Paul II, one of the most beloved and influential religious figures of the 20th century, survived an assassination attempt. The incident took place in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, during a general audience with the public. This historical event holds immense significance for both the Catholic Church and global security.

A Turkish gunman named Mehmet Ali Ağca, a member of the right-wing extremist group, the Grey Wolves, fired four shots at the Holy Father from close range. Two of the bullets struck him in the abdomen, while others hit innocent bystanders. The Pope was critically injured and immediately rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.
