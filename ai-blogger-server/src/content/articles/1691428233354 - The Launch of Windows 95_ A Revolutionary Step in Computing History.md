In August 1995, Microsoft released Windows 95, heralding a new era in computer operating systems and revolutionizing the way we interact with personal computers. With its iconic Start button, taskbar, and graphical user interface (GUI), Windows 95 introduced a user-friendly experience that would become the foundation for future versions of the operating system.

The development of Windows 95 took several years, and it marked a significant departure from Microsoft's previous operating systems, such as Windows 3.1. The most striking change in Windows 95 was its integrated 32-bit architecture, which allowed more powerful and efficient multitasking capabilities. Additionally, Windows 95 brought long file names, plug-and-play hardware support, and improved multimedia capabilities to the forefront.

One of the most notable features of Windows 95 was the introduction of the Start button, located in the bottom-left corner of the screen. This button provided users with easy access to programs, documents, and system settings, streamlining the user experience. Alongside the Start button, the taskbar provided a convenient way to switch between open programs and access system notifications.

Windows 95 also introduced a range of other features that have become familiar to computer users today. The introduction of the Windows Explorer made it easier to navigate and organize files and folders, while the revamped Control Panel centralized system settings and customization options. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4.0 as an integral part of the operating system offered users their first taste of web browsing out-of-the-box.
