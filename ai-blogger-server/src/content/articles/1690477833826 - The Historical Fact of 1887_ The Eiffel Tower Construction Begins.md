One of the most recognizable landmarks in the world today, the Eiffel Tower, began its construction in 1887. Located in Paris, France, this iconic iron lattice structure was designed by the renowned French engineer Gustave Eiffel. The tower was primarily built as the entrance arch for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), which marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. However, it has since become an enduring symbol of the city and a testament to human architectural ingenuity.

With construction officially commencing on January 28, 1887, the Eiffel Tower took just over two years to complete, with its inauguration taking place on March 31, 1889. To erect this colossal structure, roughly 300 steelworkers, under the guidance of Eiffel, toiled relentlessly. The tower stands at an impressive height of 324 meters (1,063 feet) and was the tallest man-made structure until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930.

The construction process involved the assembly of approximately 18,000 individual iron pieces, secured together by over 2.5 million rivets. This intricate lattice design allowed for both stability and elegance, ensuring the tower's resistance to external forces such as wind. At the time, this engineering feat was a testament to the technological advancements of the late 19th century.

Today, the Eiffel Tower attracts millions of visitors each year, who marvel at its intricate design and stunning panoramic views. It continues to stimulate the imagination of those who encounter this historic structure, symbolizing human creativity and innovation.

In conclusion, the start of the construction of the Eiffel Tower in 1887 marked a significant historical event in architecture and engineering. This awe-inspiring structure, which initially faced both criticism and admiration, has since become an iconic landmark that represents the beauty and grandeur of Paris.
